        <h3>About Me</h3>
         <p>Hi there! My name is Daniel Kramer, and I am a Software Engineer with a Masters student in Astroinformatics with a passion for Big Data.</p>

<p>Throughout my academic career, I have developed a strong interest in the field of Big Data and its potential to revolutionize the way we analyze and understand astronomical phenomena. As part of my studies, I have worked on several research papers in this area, including <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab1888">finding the slowest rotating asteroids</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ascom.2021.100472">implementing a period finding algorithim on GPUs</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/acac7f"> deriving properties for 30,000 asteroids</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also a proud dog owner. My furry friend, Venus, brings a lot of joy and companionship to my life.</p>

<p>When I'm not immersed in my studies or spending time with Venus, I am a passionate sports fan. I root for Atlanta sports teams, and I enjoy following their successes and challenges.</p>

<p>Overall, I am a driven and dedicated individual who is committed to pursuing my academic and personal goals with enthusiasm and determination. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me, and I look forward to exploring potential opportunities with you.</p>
